        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          Deciding what to eat should not be difficult in principle. However,
          there are so many delicious dishes to be found all over the world. We
          can readily locate many of our favorite recipes, ranging from Japanese
          sushi to Brazilian barbeque to Italian pizza to Chinese cuisines. As a
          nutshell, the most perplexing aspect of each day is determining what
          to eat in the morning, lunch, and evening. He commits "choice dilemma"
          in an instant because one wants to eat a bit and the other wants to
          try it. Therefore, I decide to create an online game based on the idea
          of divination. The design's original goal was to serve as a guide for
          individuals who are always having difficulty picking what to eat. I
          utilize a sophisticated type of divination to determine what others
          will eat for breakfast, lunch, and supper. This divination adds a
          feeling of mystery to food selection, giving people the opportunity to
          pursue life experience and subjective well-being.

        <h1>Working Progress</h1>
        <p>
          Users should initially pick from the alternatives of breakfast, lunch,
          and supper on the first page, according to the design of the web
          interface. They will notice various menus on the interface on the
          following page. The interface is more caring and inclusive, and it
          distinguishes between vegetarian and non-vegetarian options. All the
          illustrations displayed in the interface are drawn by myself. And
          there are some photographs of various cuisines on the menu that I
          chose particularly for this game. The user should then press the
          "start" button, which will cause the system to randomly pause on one
          of the food images, giving consumers some hints about what they should
          eat. I'm hoping that by presenting users with a random selection of
          foods, mini games can provide amazing adventures for those who don't
          know what to eat or are having trouble deciding.

        <h1>Reflection</h1>
        <p>
          The thought of merging food selection and divination not only
          represents the delicious choice burden presented to customers by
          today's rich and diverse food categories, but it also reflects the
          unpredictability and mystery of divination, which simply solves the
          convoluted practical value in everyday life. Emotional fulfillment is
          stronger than what you actually consume; entertainment pleasure trumps
          option suggestion. This divination experience that is near to daily
          life will be naturally and pleasantly embraced, while also broadening
          its application range. Therefore, it means that no matter how
          insightful the proposed design is, it has to have certain application
          value or it will be rejected by the market.
